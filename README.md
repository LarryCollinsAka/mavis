## AI Lesson Planner for Educators

Description:

This application is a next-generation AI tool designed to empower educators. It moves beyond simple text generation to create comprehensive, pedagogically sound lesson plans, detailed lecture notes, and accurate, topic-specific illustrations. Our goal is to serve as a creative partner for teachers, allowing them to focus on instruction while the AI handles the heavy lifting of content preparation.
